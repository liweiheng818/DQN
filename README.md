# deep q-learning & dould deep q-learning

> In this project, both DQN and DDQN algorithms were applied to solve the CartPole problem and the results were used to demonstrate the performances of two models. 
A famous DQN framework was put forward on 2015 by Volodymyr Mnih et al on Nature\cite{mnih2015human}. 
In that article, the DQN framework with CNN was demonstrated concretely. Here a deep neural network was used for replacing the convolutional neural network since the data given by environment was not raw data.
